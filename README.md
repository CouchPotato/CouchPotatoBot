CouchPotato Bot
=============

Helps out on issue reports, making sure all the important information is there before a human has time to look ;)

For now it will only responde to new issues and pull requests. Will try to improve it to explain stuff in the comments that I have to tell people about a few times a month. Like "when do I get the commits in my CP version" etc.

If you have improvements, please let me know!
